  Re-Elect Eric Zhu for SCS Senator
</div>


<br>
<h1>About Me</h1>
<div class="section">
  <i>Hey SCS!</i> I'm Eric, a sophomore CS major, and I've been one of your SCS senators for the past <b>2 years</b>.
  <ul>
    <li type="square">For the past two semesters, I've been the <b>Academic Affairs Committee Chair.</b></li>
    <li type="square">I am wholeheartedly dedicated to Senate and I care about this campus so much. But don't take my word for it&mdash;ask anyone who knows me and look at what I've done below. Hold me accountable!</li>
    <li type="square">I believe strongly in <i>realism</i> &ndash; in getting things done while recognizing what is possible and what isn't. And I make sure that what I say is what I do &mdash; I don't slack halfway through the semester.</li>

  </ul>
  Aside from Senate,
  I'm going to be a SWE intern at Google this summer and I'm a member of CMU's Mock Trial team. I'm also an econ minor.
  </br>
  My favorite 15- courses? 210 and the Truth, Justice and Algorithms special topic with Prof. Proccacia.

<h1>Concrete Results Thus Far</h1>
<div class="section">
  <ol>
    <li><b>Faculty-Student Lunches.</b> As a freshman, I proposed and spearheaded <a href="http://bit.ly/cmu-fsl" style="color:black" target="_blank">an initiative that lets you set up your own free lunch in Schatz with a faculty member</a>. It's still going on! We have some unparalleled access to world-class faculty and it would be awesome to have a culture of close faculty-student mentorships. This was on my platform last year, and now I'm working on making a permanent progmam.</li>
    <li><b>Academic Affairs White Paper.</b> I initiated a system where we'll provide actionable suggestions for improvements to policies and practices surrounding academics to people who are best equipped to make the changes. This semester, we're focusing on the interplay between <b>diversity</b> and academics and the <b>registration</b> process. We'll share them with the administration and you; keep a lookout in the Tartan!</li>
    <li><b><i>CMUStories.</i></b> For Senate Mental Health Week, I spearheaded cmustories, an initiative geared at starting a conversation about mental health through anonyously-shared, hard-hitting and unfiltered experiencess. Keep a lookout for the stories around campus, but <a href="http://bit.ly/cmu-stories" style="color:black" target="_blank">here are the raw stories</a>.</li>
    <li><b>Nightline.</b> I introduced the idea of an anonymous peer hotline in my platform last year, and in the meantime my committee has been looking into its feasibility at CMU. I'm excited to say that we're about ready to move forward with implementation!</li>
    <li><b>Wikipedia.</b> I led an initiative to edit the Carnegie Mellon Wikipedia page to enhance our reputation &ndash; originally, it was pretty bad.</li>
    <li><b>Benchmarking.</b> I was on the ad-hoc benchmarking committee we set up to find initiatives that could apply to CMU and that could make Stugov more efficient. I spoke in depth with over 8 leaders of student government at Princeton, Cornell, and Duke. We ended up working on a lot of the ideas I brought back.</li>
    <li><b>Senator Office Hours.</b> At my suggestion, Senate will be holding "office hours" in high-traffic areas of campus. Be on the lookout for SCS senators on Gates 5 soon! I've also gotten all of my committee senators to talk to their constituents about academic issues and whether what we're doing is actually needed/wanted.</li>
    <li><b>Interfacing with administration.</b> I've interfaced with the majority of the senior administration at CMU during bi-weekly meetings, trustees' meetings, and things like the President's Dinner. I brought up real and honest student concerns that really surprised some of them.</li>
    <li><b>How-to's.</b> I've written many multiple-page how-to's for future Senate chairs to replicate the success we've seen this semester.</li>
    <li><b>Senate Reports I've written.</b> Take a look at my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2lGpmG3dc5DY1NoeDRtVXhfUjQ/view?usp=sharing" style="color:black" target="_blank">F15 Final Report</a> and my <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/andrew.cmu.edu/presentation/d/1o0xUBgkfCm5YtS9MaZMcNoNSQMcA_0r6aMG6ENl8DwY/edit?usp=sharing" style="color:black" target="_blank">Senate Week Report</a>.</li>

<h1>Moving Forward</h1>
<div class="section">
  <ul>
    <li type="square"> I'd like to create an automatic feedback and complaint pipeline that will aggregate concerns and send them to the relevant people who can do something about it. It'll be as automatic as possible so that bureaucracy doesn't set into place.
    </li>
    <li type="square">Next semester, I want to administer an undergraduate-wide academic survey through Institutional Research and Analysis.
    </li>
    <li type="square">Senate should be more accountable and open. That means creating automatic feedback and reporting systems so we're beholden to you. So a better website, more physical presence on campus, ways for us to come to you.
    </li>
    <li type="square">I spend a lot of my free time thinking about how to make our work better. It goes far beyond this platform, so there's a lot that I'm missing.
    </li>
    <li type="square">I would LOVE suggestions and criticisms. Send them to ericzhu@cmu.edu or find me on Facebook!
    </li>
    <li type="square">Having been in Senate for a while, I know what needs to happen for rhetoric to turn into action. I challenge my senators to think this way, and we've seen a lot come as a result.
    </li>
